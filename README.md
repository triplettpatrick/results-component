# Results Component 

This is a card component using HTML and CSS files. The purpose of this card is to showcase results that a user might obtain when completing an online exam that tests various mental capabilities that are being observed. 

# Features 

The card has several features that enhance the user experience. These include:

A responsive design that adapts to the size of the viewport, which makes this application easy to view on mobile devices. A large score which tells the user how well they performed. A message-type element which allows the user to see how well they did in a short word or phrase. Along with each message-type, there is a short message that details how well the user did compared to the general population of exam takers. There is, also, a numerical breakdown of how the user performed in the various sections of the exam, scored out of 100 possible points. Finally, there is a button that changes color when hovered over.
